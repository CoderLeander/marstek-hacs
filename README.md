This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that allows you to monitor Marstek battery systems via UDP communication. The integration provides comprehensive monitoring of your Marstek battery system with **25+ sensors** covering battery status, power management, network connectivity, and system information.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites - API Access Required

**IMPORTANT**: The API on Marstek batteries is **disabled by default**. You must request API access before this integration will work.

### How to Enable API Access:

1. **Request API access** by contacting Marstek through their contact form: https://eu.marstekenergy.com/nl-be/pages/contact
2. **Mention in your message** that you want to enable the API for Home Assistant integration
3. **Wait for confirmation** from Marstek support
4. **Check your mobile app** - You'll know the API is enabled when you see an "**Advanced**" section appear in your Marstek mobile app
5. **Configure the API** in the Advanced section:
   - Enable/disable the API
   - Set the port (default: 30000)

## Features

- **25+ sensors** monitoring all aspects of your Marstek system
- **Comprehensive coverage**:
  - Battery status (voltage, current, power, temperature, SOC)
  - System mode and power management
  - Energy monitoring (grid, solar, load power)
  - Network connectivity (WiFi and Bluetooth status)
  - Device information and diagnostics
- **Real-time updates** every minute with intelligent rate limiting
- **Easy setup** through Home Assistant UI with automatic device discovery
- **Local communication** (no cloud required, direct UDP to your battery)
- **Retry logic** for reliable connection during setup
- **HACS compatible** for easy installation and updates

## Installation

### Step 1: Install via HACS (Recommended)

1. **Install HACS** if you haven't already: [HACS Installation Guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download)
2. **Add this repository to HACS**:
   - Go to HACS ‚Üí Integrations
   - Click the three dots (‚ãÆ) in the top right corner
   - Select "Custom repositories"
   - Add this repository URL and select "Integration" as the category
   - Click "Add"
3. **Install the integration**:
   - Find "Marstek Battery" in HACS
   - Click "Download"
   - Restart Home Assistant

### Step 2: Add the Integration

1. **Navigate to integrations**: Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration
2. **Search for "Marstek"** and select the Marstek Battery integration
3. **Enter your device information**:
   - **Device IP Address**: Find your battery's IP address in your router or Marstek app (e.g., `192.168.1.142`)
   - **Remote Port**: The API port configured in your Marstek app (default: `30000`)
   - **Local Port**: Port for Home Assistant to use (default: `30000`)
4. **Click Submit**: The integration will test the connection with up to 3 automatic retries
5. **Success**: Your Marstek device and 25+ sensors will appear in Home Assistant

### Alternative: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Copy the `custom_components/marstek` folder to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Follow Step 2 above to add the integration

## How It Works

- **Discovery**: The integration automatically discovers your Marstek device and extracts all available information
- **Polling**: Updates all sensors every **1 minute** with intelligent rate limiting to avoid overwhelming your battery
- **Reliability**: Built-in retry logic ensures stable connection during setup and operation
- **Local Communication**: Direct UDP communication with your battery (no internet required)

## Supported Devices

This integration has been tested with:

- Marstek battery systems with UDP/JSON-RPC API capability
- Requires API access enabled by Marstek support

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå API Not Enabled (Most Common Issue)

**Problem**: Integration shows "cannot_connect" error during setup

**Solution**:
1. **Verify API is enabled**: Check your Marstek mobile app for "Advanced" section
2. **If no Advanced section**: Contact Marstek support at <https://eu.marstekenergy.com/nl-be/pages/contact> to request API access
3. **Wait for activation**: API activation may take some time after Marstek enables it
4. **Check port settings**: Ensure the port in the Advanced section matches your configuration (default: 30000)

### üîå Connection Issues

**Problem**: Timeout errors or connection failures

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify IP address**: Check your router or Marstek app for the correct device IP
2. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure Home Assistant can reach your battery's network
3. **Port conflicts**: Make sure port 30000 isn't used by other applications
4. **Firewall**: Verify no firewall is blocking UDP traffic on port 30000
5. **WiFi network**: Ensure both Home Assistant and the battery are on the same network or have proper routing

### üìä Sensor Issues

**Problem**: Some sensors show "Unknown" or missing values

**Explanations**:
- **Normal behavior**: Not all sensors may have data at all times (e.g., solar power at night)
- **Battery state dependent**: Some values only appear during specific operations
- **API response variations**: Different battery models may provide different data sets

### üîß Advanced Debugging

Enable detailed logging by adding this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.marstek: debug
```

**Restart Home Assistant** after adding the logging configuration. Check the logs for detailed API communication information.

## FAQ

### Q: Why do I need to contact Marstek to enable the API?
**A**: The API is disabled by default for security reasons. Marstek enables it manually upon request to ensure only authorized users can access the battery's data interface.

### Q: How often does the integration update sensor data?
**A**: All sensors update every **60 seconds (1 minute)** with built-in rate limiting to prevent overwhelming your battery system.

### Q: Can I change the update frequency?
**A**: The 1-minute interval is optimized for battery health and system stability. Faster updates are not recommended as they may impact battery performance.

### Q: What happens if my battery doesn't respond?
**A**: The integration includes retry logic during setup (3 attempts). During normal operation, failed updates simply wait for the next cycle.

### Q: Do I need internet access?
**A**: No, the integration communicates directly with your battery via your local network. No cloud or internet connection is required.
